        <h1>Electronic Fashion Camp</h1>
        <p>A three-day camp introducing new technologies that combine concepts from the disciplines of engineering, computer science, fashion and design to girls ages 10-12 years.</p>

        <p><img src="camp/amy.jpg" alt="electronicfashioncamp" style="width:304px;"></p>

        <p>I wanted to empower girls with the ability to make an informed choice about their future by exposing them to new technologies that interested them. I found out that during the fifth and sixth grades is when a student typically decides if they want to puruse interests in STEM or not. I wanted to show women and girls in my local community that engineering and computer science can mean many things and cross over many fields.</p>

        <img src="camp/efcamp1.jpg" alt="electronicfashioncamp" style="width:230px;">

        <p>The three core building blocks of developing this event were:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Research &amp; Development: Gaining a strong understanding of the LilyPad Arduino, how to engage girls in the development of LilyPad Arduino projects, planning volunteer and participant engagement</li>
          <li>Event &amp; Team Organization: Finding participants, volunteers, sponsorship and local support through a great network and the use of social media&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Going Forward: For those interested in starting up their own workshops, develop a handy online guide to explain the process</li>
        </ol>
         
        <p>There was a significant amount of interest in the Dallas community when I launched the camp. In the future I would like to package this experience for educational institutions in a way that would allow more girls to work with the LilyPad Arduino</p>

        <h1>LilyPad Arduino Workshop, Design Your World Conference</h1>
        <p>A two hour workshop introducing girls to Women in Engineering, the Software Development Lifecycle, Wearables and the LilyPad Arduino, a microprocessor board designed for e-textiles. Girls work in groups of 2-3 to complete basic exercises in Sketch, the Arduino programming environment.</p>

        <p><img src="lilypadworkshop/girlscouts.jpg" alt="lilypadarduino" style="width:450px;"></p>

        <p>I volunteered to help plan the first annual Design Your World Conference, a STEM conference for girls. In addition to running the Marketing and Participant groups, I produced a LilyPad Arduino workshop for a group of the girls attending.</p>

        <p><img src="lilypadworkshop/lilypadworkshop.jpg" alt="lilypadarduino" style="width:450px;"></p>

        The workshop consisted of a presentation by a fellow woman engineer, an explination of what the LilyPad Arduino is, what it can do and how it works, followed by a tinkering session where the girls made LEDs blink; we provided other sensors and actuators for the girls to choose from and explore further.

        <h1>2010 SWE Region C Conference</h1>
        <p>The Society of Women Engineers hosts annual regional conferences and one national conference each year. University SWE sections submit bids to host the conference in their region and in collaboration with the local professional sections, plan the next years conference if they win.</p>

        <p>I served as Chair of the 2010 Society of Women Engineers Region C Conference. Over the course of six months, I managed and supported several volunteer committees throughout the planning and execution of the conference. What came out was a three day conference with over 300 members in attendance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>corporate sponsorship, worked with local and national companies to raise a $60,000 budget</li>
          <li>vendor and hotel arrangements</li>
          <li>tours and attractions</li>
          <li>workshop sessions, meals, keynote dinner</li>
          <li>registration and conference awareness campaigns</li>
          <li>designed all materials (all program materials, conference swag, logo, t-shirts)</li>
          <li>developed the conference website and maintained our social media presence</li>
        </ul>
