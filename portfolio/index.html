        <h2>Electronic Fashion Camp</h2>
        <p>A three-day camp introducing new technologies that combine concepts from the disciplines of engineering, computer science, fashion and design to girls ages 10-12 years.</p>

        <p><img src="camp/amy.jpg" alt="electronicfashioncamp" style="width:304px;"></p>

        <p>I wanted to empower girls with the ability to make an informed choice about their future by exposing them to new technologies that interested them. The NSF claims that during fifth and sixth grade is when a student typically decides if she wants to puruse interests in STEM or not. 

        I developed the Electronic Fashion Camp as a way to show women and girls in my local community that engineering and computer science can mean many things and cross over many fields.</p>

        <img src="camp/efcamp1.jpg" alt="electronicfashioncamp" style="width:230px;"></p>

        <p>The core building blocks of developing this event were:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Research &amp; Development: I needed to understand a few things before getting started: the LilyPad Arduino, how to engage girls in the development of LilyPad Arduino projects, planning volunteer and participant engagement.</li>
          <li>Event &amp; Team Organization: I found participants, volunteers, sponsorship and local support through the network I built during my time in Dallas and through social media. I found women from many fields interested in this work including: engineers, technologists, programmers, business marketers, artists and academics. Over the course of six months leading into the camp, I built workshops to teach them the LilyPad Arduino and establish a sense of community among the volunteers.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Event Execution: We collaborated as a community of women, utilizing our diverse skillsets throughout the camp. Over the three days, the girls participating completed bonding and sisterhood activities, and heard from women engineers and media experts while designing, prototyping, testing and producing their own LilyPad Arduino project.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Going Forward: For those interested in starting up their own workshops, I want to develop a packaged product and online guides to explain the process. I am also interested in packaging this for educational institutions to use. </p>

        <h2>LilyPad Arduino Workshop, Design Your World Conference</h2>
        <p>A two hour workshop introducing girls to: Women Engineers, the Software Development Lifecycle, Wearables and the LilyPad Arduino, a microprocessor board designed for e-textiles. Girls work in groups of 2-3 to complete basic exercises in Sketch, the Arduino programming environment.</p>

        <p><img src="lilypadworkshop/girlscouts.jpg" alt="lilypadarduino" style="width:450px;"></p>

        <p>While earning my Masters in Emerging Media and Communications (EMAC), I volunteered to help plan the first annual Design Your World Conference, a STEM conference for girls. I was interested in all things new media and decided to use my skills to run the Marketing and Participant teams. </p>

        <p><img src="lilypadworkshop/lilypadworkshop.jpg" alt="lilypadarduino" style="width:450px;"></p>

        <p>After we built out the structure of the conference, I found another opportunity to help out in planning one of the many workshops offered during the conference. I used the research I was currently completing in my last year of the EMAC program as inspiration and produced a LilyPad Arduino workshop.</p>

         <p><img src="lilypadworkshop/amyteach.jpg" alt="lilypadarduino" style="width:450px;"></p>

        <p>The workshop consisted of a presentation by a fellow woman engineer, an explination of what the LilyPad Arduino is, what it can do and how it works, followed by a tinkering session where the girls made LEDs blink; we provided other sensors and actuators for the girls to choose from and explore further.</p>

      <p>I spent a few years working the decks at RadioUTD, the UT Dallas student run radio station. New shows ran each semester and occasionally I was lucky enough to have a co-hosts. I enjoyed focusing in on one genre each semester. Most challenging was the semester I chose to focus on punk; punk songs are usually less than 2 minutes long.</p>
